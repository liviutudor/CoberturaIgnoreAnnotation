CoberturaIgnoreAnnotation
=========================

Testing the cobertura ignore annotation functionality.

This project is simply to test the Cobertura Gradle plugin and its behaviour when it comes to `coverageIgnoreMethodAnnotations`. See the plugin page: https://github.com/stevesaliman/gradle-cobertura-plugin/blob/master/usage.md

See also [this page](https://github.com/cobertura/cobertura/wiki/Coverage-Annotations) which talks about the coverage annotations.

This project accompanies my blog post which presents the findings: http://liviutudor.com/2015/05/14/cobertura-issue-with-ignoring-annotated-methods
